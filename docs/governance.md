# Governance (Human Involvement & Overrides)

## Goal
Make it clear what is automated, what can be overridden, and how changes are tracked.

## Automation vs human involvement (high-level)
- Signals are generated by the system
- Humans may:
  - update documentation
  - patch schema/validation rules
  - disable output under data integrity failures

## Override policy (public principle)
If any manual intervention exists, it should be:
- rule-based
- logged
- not hindsight-edited after outcomes

## Change management
- version tags in outputs
- transparency-pack changelog in `/changelog/CHANGELOG.md`
- issues tracked via GitHub Issues where possible
