# Risk Policy (No-Hype Rules)

## Principles
- No guaranteed profit
- Auditability over marketing
- Prefer paper-testing before any real-money usage
- Promote responsible behavior and legal compliance (age/location)

## What we publish
- Timestamped logs
- Version tags
- Fail cases / invalidation notes when applicable

## What we avoid
- “Sure win” language
- Claims without raw logs
- Selective cherry-picking without context

## Drawdowns & losing streaks
Losses happen in any probabilistic system. If we publish ROI/CLV, we also publish:
- sample size
- drawdown context
- failure modes

## When signals may be reduced/stopped (examples)
- missing or delayed inputs
- integrity checks fail
- low-confidence states
