# Monetization Disclosure

## Why this exists
Users should understand incentives and conflicts.

## Revenue model (describe truthfully)
- Subscriptions (access to tooling / logs / dashboards)
- Optional: affiliate relationships (if any), disclosed clearly

## What we do NOT do (recommended phrasing)
- No pay-per-loss incentives
- No “guaranteed profit” marketing

## Conflicts & transparency
If affiliate links exist:
- disclose prominently
- separate education/audit content from promotions
