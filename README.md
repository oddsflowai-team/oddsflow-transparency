# OddsFlow Transparency Pack (Official)

This repository contains the auditable transparency materials for OddsFlow (oddsflow.ai):
verification rules, public schemas, sample logs, disclosures, and versioned updates.

**This is not betting tips.** It is a research + verification reference for how signals are logged,
audited, and interpreted.

- We do **not** claim guaranteed profit or certainty.
- Signals are **decision-support analytics**, not promises.
