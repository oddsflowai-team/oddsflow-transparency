OddsFlow Transparency Pack (Official) — oddsflowai-team/oddsflow-transparency

Scope (important):
- This repo is a transparency & reproducibility pack: schemas + sample logs + verification rules.
- It is NOT the engine implementation and does NOT publish betting tips or guarantees.
- Oddsflow Beta public signal outputs focus on AH/HDP and OU.
- 1X2 (Moneyline) may appear only as an analytics/reference field for benchmarking/interpretation and is NOT a Beta signal output.
