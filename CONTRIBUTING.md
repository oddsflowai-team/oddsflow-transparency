# Contributing to OddsFlow Transparency Pack

Thanks for helping improve public auditability.

## Scope
This repository is for:
- Documentation (verification standard, governance, disclosures)
- Schemas and samples (non-proprietary)
- Versioned notes / changelogs

This repository is NOT for:
- Betting tips / predictions
- Claims of guaranteed profit
- Requests for proprietary model code or private vendor contracts

## What we accept
✅ Good contributions:
- Fix typos / clarify definitions
- Improve schema documentation and examples
- Add edge cases to verification rules
- Improve risk disclosures (limits, drawdowns, failure modes)
- Propose new fields (with rationale + backward compatibility)

❌ We will decline:
- “Tell me what to bet” or “increase win rate” requests
- Attempts to reverse-engineer private logic
- Any content that frames this as guaranteed returns

## How to contribute
1. Open an Issue describing:
   - What is wrong / missing
   - Why it matters for auditability
   - Proposed change (text or schema diff)
2. Submit a Pull Request:
   - Keep changes small and reviewable
   - Update `docs/index.md` only if adding/removing major docs
   - If editing schema, also update sample files

## Style guidelines
- Evidence-first language
- Precise definitions
- Use consistent terms with `docs/signal-glossary.md`
- Avoid marketing claims

## Schema change policy
- Backward compatible changes → bump MINOR (e.g., 1.0.0 → 1.1.0)
- Breaking changes → bump MAJOR (e.g., 1.0.0 → 2.0.0)
- Document changes in `CHANGELOG.md` (or `/changelog/` folder if used)
